Random Password Generator and Checker
This Python script generates a random password and checks it against a user-provided password. It can be useful for creating a simple password generator for fun or educational purposes. However, it is not suitable for secure password generation in real-world applications.

Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3.x and uses the getpass library for securely obtaining user input.

Usage
Run the script in your Python environment.

You will be prompted to enter a password using the getpass library, which hides the input for added security.

The script will generate random passwords until it matches the user's input. It does this by picking random digits from the password list and checking if the generated password matches the user's input.

Once a match is found, the script will print the matched password, indicating that the task is complete.

Please note that this code is for educational purposes and should not be used for creating secure passwords. Secure passwords should be generated using a reliable password manager or library that adheres to best practices for password security.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the script:

less
Copy code
$ python random_password_checker.py
Enter password: [Your Secure Password]
[Randomly Generated Password]
[Randomly Generated Password]
...
[Randomly Generated Password]
[Randomly Generated Password]
[Your Secure Password]
Your password is [Your Secure Password]

This code is for educational purposes and should not be used for generating secure passwords. In real-world applications, always use strong, unique passwords and consider using a reputable password manager for password management.
